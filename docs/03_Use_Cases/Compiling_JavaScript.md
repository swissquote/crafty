When compiling JavaScript, you have to know wether you are going to develop in
an application or a library. The good news is that Crafty makes it a breeze to
switch from one to the other.

## Compiling JavaScript for a webapp ( Webpack )

When developing for a webapp, you wish for all files to be packed into the
smallest number of files, because the number of requests that a final
application will make are directly related to the performance of that
application.

Webpack does a great job at optimizing your bundles into the
smallest possible package.

### Installing the preset with Webpack

```bash
cd src/main/frontend
npm install @swissquote/crafty @swissquote/crafty-preset-babel @swissquote/crafty-runner-webpack --save
```

In your `crafty.config.js` file, you must add the following presets and create a
bundle.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    "@swissquote/crafty-preset-babel",
    "@swissquote/crafty-runner-webpack",
  ],
  js: {
    app: {
      runner: "webpack",
      source: "js/index.js",
    },
  },
};
```

You are now ready to run `crafty run` and compile your JavaScript source files
with Webpack.

## Compiling JavaScript for a library ( Gulp )

When developing a library, you can either go the same direction as a webapp and
merge all the files into one bundle, or you can keep each source file in a
separate compiled file and use them as-is.

The advantage of the second approach is that the Tree-Shaking that can be done
in the final application is much more efficient if the compiled files stay
separate. (Like a component library).

### Installing the preset with Gulp

```bash
cd src/main/frontend
npm install @swissquote/crafty @swissquote/crafty-preset-babel @swissquote/crafty-runner-gulp --save
```

In your `crafty.config.js` file, you must add the following presets and create a
bundle.

You can see that the bundle we created contains a glob as the source, this means
that all source files will be compiled separately, and the dependencies between
the files won't be resolved (like Webpack would do).

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    "@swissquote/crafty-preset-babel",
    "@swissquote/crafty-runner-gulp",
  ],
  js: {
    lib: {
      runner: "gulp",
      source: "js/**/*.js",
    },
  },
};
```

You are now ready to run `crafty run` and compile your JavaScript source files
with Gulp.

## Features

By leveraging Babel we are able to use EcmaScript 2015+ and compile to
EcmaScript 5.

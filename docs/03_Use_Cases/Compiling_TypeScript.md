When compiling TypeScript, like for JavaScript, you have to know wether you are
going to develop in an application or a library. The good news is that Crafty
makes it a breeze to switch from one to the other.

## Compiling TypeScript for a webapp ( Webpack / rollup.js )

When developing for a webapp, you wish for all files to be packed into the
smallest number of files, because the number of requests that a final
application will make are directly related to the performance of that
application.

Webpack and rollup.js do a great job at optimizing your bundles into the
smallest possible package. For this use case, we are going to use Webpack, but
they are interchangeable in this example.

### Installing the preset with Webpack

```bash
cd src/main/frontend
npm install @swissquote/crafty @swissquote/crafty-preset-typescript @swissquote/crafty-runner-webpack --save
```

In your `crafty.config.js` file, you must add the following presets and create a
bundle.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    "@swissquote/crafty-preset-typescript",
    "@swissquote/crafty-runner-webpack"
  ],
  js: {
    app: {
      runner: "webpack",
      source: "js/index.ts"
    }
  }
};
```

Then, you can create a `tsconfig.json` next to `crafty.config.js`.

```json
{
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "node", "css", "etc"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "charset": "UTF-8",
    "jsx": "react",
    "module": "esnext", // Using an ES6 module with an ES5 target allows to leverage tree shaking
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["DOM", "ES2017", "DOM.Iterable", "ScriptHost"]
  }
}
```

You are now ready to run `crafty run` and compile your TypeScript source files
with Webpack.

## Compiling TypeScript for a library ( Gulp )

When developing a library, you can either go the same direction as a webapp and
merge all the files into one bundle, or you can keep each source file in a
separate compiled file and use them as-is.

The advantage of the second approach is that the Tree-Shaking that can be done
in the final application is much more efficient if the compiled files stay
separate. (Like a component library).

This approach is not recommended if you know that the majority of your library
will always be used, as we would recommend to use rollup.js in that case.

### Installing the preset with Gulp

```bash
cd src/main/frontend
npm install @swissquote/crafty @swissquote/crafty-preset-typescript @swissquote/crafty-runner-gulp --save
```

In your `crafty.config.js` file, you must add the following presets and create a
bundle.

You can see that the bundle we created contains a glob as the source, this means
that all source files will be compiled separately, and the dependencies between
the files won't be resolved (like Webpack or rollup.js would do).

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    "@swissquote/crafty-preset-typescript",
    "@swissquote/crafty-runner-gulp"
  ],
  js: {
    lib: {
      runner: "gulp/typescript",
      source: "js/**/*.ts"
    }
  }
};
```

Then, you can create a `tsconfig.json` next to `crafty.config.js`.

```json
{
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "node", "css", "etc"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "charset": "UTF-8",
    "jsx": "react",
    "module": "esnext", // Using an ES6 module with an ES5 target allows to leverage tree shaking
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": ["DOM", "ES2017", "DOM.Iterable", "ScriptHost"]
  }
}
```

You are now ready to run `crafty run` and compile your TypeScript source files
with Gulp.

## Features

All features that exist in EcmaScript 2016 are supported in TypeScript.

On top of that, TypeScript supports optional typing for each variable, function
parameter and return type.

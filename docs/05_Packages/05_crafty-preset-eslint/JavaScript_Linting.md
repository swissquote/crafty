Linting is the process of verifying your source code for common errors.

With the help of [ESLint](http://eslint.org) we created a default configuration that follows this standard.

## Fixing linting errors automatically

Some linting errors, like variable renaming, require an human mind to be fixed, but others don't.

**ESLint** comes with a useful command line flag to fix the errors automatically.

We bundled a [command line tool](../../CLI.md) that will leverage this and help you fix your JavaScript errors.

## Linting in development

Linting is important but while writing code, formatting is not the most important thing and failing the build for something as insignificant as a space is more annoying than helpful. That's why in Crafty, formatting rules are in warning mode during development (with `crafty watch`) so that you can focus on programming and not on formatting.

## Turning off linting for some parts of your code

You might find yourself surprised with the number of errors you get when you lint your JavaScript files for the first time.

Here I'll explain how to disable linting on some files or part of files, but remember! The linting is here to help you! You should have good reasons to disable linting.

Good reasons include:

- It's an external library you downloaded, so it should not follow our conventions
- you are adding a `console.log` but wrapped in a `if` statement to check if "console" exists in the global scope.

### Disable linting on a line

To be surgical you can also disable the linting on a single line with `eslint-disable-line`

An optional feature is to add which rules are disabled. In this example we disable the `no-console` rule. We recommend to do this whenever you need to disable linting in a file.
You can find the rule name at the end of the error message you get when compiling.

```javascript
if (console) {
  console.log("Les carottes sont cuites"); //eslint-disable-line no-console
}
```

### Disable linting on a block of code

You should use this possibility if you're sure of what you do.
To disable linting on a block you can add the following comments around your block

```javascript
/* eslint-disable */

// suppress all warnings between comments
alert("foo");

/* eslint-enable */
```

### Disable linting for one or more files

When running, **ESLint** will look for a `.eslintignore` file in it's working directory and apply all the patterns to ignore some files.

The patterns in your `.eslintignore` file must match the [`.gitignore` syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

For example:

```
vendor/**.css
```

> The `.eslintignore` file's location changes wether you want to disable linting from **Crafty** or the Mercurial hooks.
>
> For the hooks, the file must be at the root of your repository (next to your `.hgignore`/`.gitignore`).
>
> For **Crafty**, the file must be in the Gulp working directory (generally `src/main/frontend`).

## Customizing the rules

ESLint [contains a lot of rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

We created a default set of rules following the Swissquote JavaScript Guideline, but if your project wants stricter rules, you can enable them like that :

```javascript
module.exports = {
  eslint: {
    rules: {
      "arrow-parens": ["error", "always"],
    },
  },
};
```

### Adding an ESLint plugin

You can add ESLint plugins to use within your project.
Add that to your `crafty.config.js`.

```javascript
// Import the plugin you wish to use
import depend from 'eslint-plugin-depend';

export default {
  presets: ["@swissquote/crafty-preset-swc"],
  eslint: {
    plugins: {
      // Declare the plugin in your configuration
      depend,
    },
    rules: {
      // Declare the rules you want to use
      'depend/ban-dependencies': 'error'
    }
  }
};
```

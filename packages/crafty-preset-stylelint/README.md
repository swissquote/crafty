## Commands

### `crafty cssLint`

This command will lint CSS files using Stylelint's CLI too, you can get it's documentation [here](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/cli/).

The additions made by this command are:

- Pre-configured rules, defined by [`stylelint-config-swissquote`](05_Packages/10_stylelint-config-swissquote.md) activated using `--preset`.
- Set the syntax to `scss`.

there are 3 presets available for you :

- `recommended`: Contains all BEM specific rules.
- `legacy`: Contains rules specific to legacy code.
- `common`: Enforces the styleguide of the CSS. (included in both `recommended` and `legacy`)

Setting presets is done with the `--preset` option

The order of the presets is important as some rules might override previous ones.

It can be used the following way:

```bash
crafty cssLint css/**/*.scss --preset recommended
```

If no preset is specified `recommended` is used.

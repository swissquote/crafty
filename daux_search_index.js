Linted your JavaScript with ESLint. Create a CSS bundle compiled with PostCSS. Lint your CSS with Stylelint. Run your tests with Jest and compile them with Babel. #Why Getting started in a web application is easy, write an index.html, a style.css, and a script.js file and you\u2019re good to go. But on bigger apps you might want some CSS preprocessing ? but which one to choose ? Sass, Less, Stylus, PostCSS ? Then you want to write your JavaScript using EcmaScript 2015+, but do you transpile it with Traceur or Babel ? Then you have to package your JavaScript in bundles, you have the choice between rollup.js, Browserify, Webpack or Pundle. Now you want to lint your JavaScript, do you choose ESLint or JSHint ? To orchestrate all this, do you use Gulp, Broccoli or Grunt ? You guessed it, each tool in the JavaScript stack has at least two alternatives, and there is not always a clear winner. This lead to a \u201cJavaScript Fatigue\u201d in the community these last years and some people got lost in what tools to choose to do these tasks. But even when you chose the tool you want to work with, you still have to configure it, maintain it up to date and follow up on changes. Crafty is an attempt to create a package that is simple to install and configure. Specify your JavaScript and CSS files in entry and get them compiled, compressed and linted with the best tools available. Each tool is fine-tuned to give the best and to follow Swissquote\u2019s Guidelines and best practices for Frontend development. Most aspects of Crafty are configurable and updates are painless. More on Why #Features The main feature of Crafty is to compile your JavaScript, CSS, compress your images and deliver them in the target directory. But shortening the list of features you gain with Crafty to one sentence doesn\u2019t give it\u2019s full measure. Here\u2019s some other features it has: #JavaScript Write EcmaScript 2015, transpiled to JavaScript all browsers understand with Babel. Write TypeScript, transpiled to EcmaScript 5 with the TypeScript compiler. Bundle all JavaScript files together with the help of Webpack. Compress the output with Terser to create the smallest possible bundles. Lint your code with ESLint, points you to possible mistakes and formatting errors. Simple debugging with Source Maps. Read more about features here #CSS Preprocess your CSS using PostCSS and plugins that will allow you to write in a syntax approaching the one of Scss. Use future CSS Syntax and features today like nesting, advanced colors, and custom properties. Compress the CSS output with @parcel\/css to get the smallest possible file. Automatically add or remove vendor prefixes where they are needed. Simple Debugging with Source Maps Read more about features here #Images With the help of crafty-preset-images you can also compress your images (svg\/png\/jpg\/gif). Read more about features and configuration here #Watching for Changes \/ Hot Module Replacement By running the gulp watch command, a process is launched to trigger a rebuild of your asset on each change in src\/main\/frontend. A change on the configuration while Watching will reconfigure itself. For Assets built with Webpack this can be even more powerful : after compiling your code, it can change the code within the browsers without reloading. Here\u2019s an example: Read more about watch #Maven, Node.js and Gulp Swissquote\u2019s build environment is based mainly on Maven and it\u2019s plugin ecosystem. But the Frontend world relies on Node.js tooling to build JavaScript and CSS assets. To use the best of both worlds, we take advantage of the maven-frontend-plugin. This plugin will ensure a Node.js version is installed and will run an npm install to install our JavaScript dependencies. We also use Gulp, a JavaScript task runner (can be seen a bit like Ant but for the JavaScript world). Crafty is the glue that will take all these pieces we mentioned, and build you assets with the best-in-class tools. Working with Swissquote\u2019s JavaScript and CSS Guidelines as well. Everything bundled in a way that mvn clean install will build your assets like you would expect with pure Java plugins. #Getting started To get started, follow the guide","tags":"","url":"index.html"},{"title":"Getting Started","text":"To get started, you need to follow at least these steps : Install Crafty and the presets you wish to use.

If we take this JavaScript bundle : app: { \/\/ name of the bundle source: ['js\/panel.js', 'js\/nothing.js'], } This will automatically create a file in &lt;destination_js&gt;\/app.min.js containing both source files that will be minified. The file name is taken from the bundle name if no destination is specified #Common Bundle options Option Type Optional ? Description source String\/Array No One single file or an array of files you wish to compile. Glob expressions are valid. runner String No The name of the runner to use for this bundle. Is mandatory if more than one runner is loaded destination String Yes The name to give to the final file. Defaults to &lt;bundle_name&gt;.min.&lt;bundle_type&gt; watch String\/Array Yes The watch expression to use to rebuild this asset. Any glob expression is valid, is needed for Gulp in watch mode.

You can also use create a vendor directory either in the js\/css folder or in frontend if your libraries contains both JavaScript and CSS files. #Bundle names Your bundle names should have an expressive name, if you have a single bundle, name it either \u201capp\u201d or the name of your application. #Bundle destinations When setting a destination, you should always prefix the extension with \u201c.min\u201d for example file.min.js or file.min.css This is a convention that allows some tools to know the content is minified. And will bring you the following benefits : When compressing files together, a file with \u201c.min\u201d in the name will not be minified again, thus you get a performance boost.

This option is, for example, used by Autoprefixer to define which CSS Prefixes it needs to add to the CSS file. We created this list of browsers based on the statistics of browser usage we have seen across all Swissquote Platforms. If you want a different list, you can override those defaults using any valid Browserslist query source #terser : JavaScript compression Default: { compress: true, sourceMap: true } By default, we compress our JavaScript with safe parameters. If you wish, you can go further and enable more advanced compression techniques. Terser\u2019s documentation has all the details on its options. #stylelint_pattern: Which files to lint Default: [&quot;css\/**\/*.scss&quot;, &quot;css\/**\/*.css&quot;, &quot;!*.min.css&quot;, &quot;!**\/vendor\/**\/*.scss&quot;, &quot;!**\/vendor\/**\/*.css&quot;, &quot;!**\/vendor\/*.scss&quot;, &quot;!**\/vendor\/*.css&quot;] Define the file types you want to target when linting CSS files. #externals to not bundle dependencies By default, all bundlers include all external dependencies in the final bundle. Including all dependencies works fine for applications, but if you wish to build a multi-tenant application or a library, you might not want to include all dependencies because you\u2019ll end up with the same dependency more than one time. The externals option allows you to define a list of provided libraries and should not be embedded in the build. Here is an example : module.exports = { ... \/\/ patterns are strings or globs externals: [\"react\", \"react-dom\", \"moment\", \"moment\/**\"], ... js: { app: { \/\/ You can provide more items here, they will be merged with the main list for this bundle externals: [\"my-plugin\", \"my-plugin\/**\"] ... } } ... } In this example, react, react-dom, and all modules starting with moment\/ will be treated as external This configuration example uses glob patterns. These patterns work fine for Webpack but are not supported by rollup.js. #js and css Bundles The two configuration objects inside css and js are what Crafty uses to create the build tasks when running crafty run. A bundle is a set of one or more source files that a runner compiles to one or more destination files. From these three options, one is mandatory; source. If we take this JavaScript bundle : { presets: [ \"@swissquote\/crafty-runner-gulp\", \"@swissquote\/crafty-preset-babel\" ], js: { app: { \/\/ name of the bundle source: ['js\/panel.js', 'js\/nothing.js'], concat: true } } } This configuration will: Use the gulp\/babel runner implicitly, as no other runner is available. Read js\/panel.js and js\/nothing.js. Convert them using the Babel preset. Concatenate both files together; That option is exclusive to the gulp runner. Write the file to &lt;destination_js&gt;\/app.min.js. Which is inferred from the bundle name because no destination was specified. #Common Bundle options Option Type Optional ? Description source `string string[]` No runner string No The runner\u2019s name to use for this bundle. This option is mandatory if more than one runner is loaded destination string Yes The name to give to the final file. Defaults to &lt;bundle_name&gt;.min.&lt;bundle_type&gt; watch `string string[]` Yes #Runners You can define which runner should run for which bundle. The different values are Runner Name Bundle Type Required presets webpack JavaScript @swissquote\/crafty-runner-webpack rollup JavaScript @swissquote\/crafty-runner-rollup gulp\/babel JavaScript @swissquote\/crafty-runner-gulp + @swissquote\/crafty-preset-babel gulp\/typescript JavaScript @swissquote\/crafty-runner-gulp + @swissquote\/crafty-preset-typescript gulp\/swc JavaScript @swissquote\/crafty-runner-gulp + @swissquote\/crafty-preset-babel gulp\/postcss CSS @swissquote\/crafty-runner-gulp + @swissquote\/crafty-preset-postcss #CSS Bundles { presets: [ \"@swissquote\/crafty-runner-gulp\", \"@swissquote\/crafty-preset-postcss\" ], css: { testIndex: { source: 'css\/test\/test.scss', destination: 'index.min.css', watch: 'css\/test\/**.scss' } } } testIndex is the bundle name; you will be able to call crafty run css_testIndex to build it. CSS bundling provides no particular option. When bundling your CSS inside your JavaScript, you must set the configuration in the JavaScript bundle. #JavaScript Bundles app: { source: ['js\/panel.js', 'js\/nothing.js'], destination: 'app.min.js' } app is the bundle name; you will be able to call crafty run js_app to build it.

Crafty comes with three default commands, reads one configuration file and loads presets. All the rest is handled by presets. #The philosophy Crafty\u2019s philosophy is that there are great build and automation tools out there, we don\u2019t want to reinvent them. Gulp is awesome to create tasks and streams of work, Webpack is great at creating bundles, PostCSS and its plugin ecosystem is big. But what plugins and loaders should we use for our needs ? Crafty\u2019s philosophy is that if you wish to use Gulp and Webpack together, it should be easy. If you want to use TypeScript instead of Babel, it should be a single configuration line change. The default configuration should allow you to get started in a couple of minutes, but you should be able to fine-tune the configuration to your needs. Another aspect is that configuring your build process once is one thing, keeping it up-to-date is more complicated. Does a new major version of PostCSS work with my existing plugins ? Does this minor update introduce a breaking change by mistake ? Crafty takes care of that heavy lifting and helps you keep your package.json small. #What\u2019s inside #Bundles In Crafty, a bundle is a piece of configuration that represents one or more source files and one destination file. (In some cases, more than one destination file.) Each bundle has to be treated by a runner. #Runners A runner\u2019s purpose is to take a bundle and turn it into a task that will then take your files and compile them. Each runner can be augmented with presets. #Presets Presets are a way to extend Crafty\u2019s capabilities with new tasks, commands, runners and configuration. Each preset can use any number of extension points (functions) that will be executed by crafty or other presets. We have an extension point that can override the configuration, an extension point to add Babel plugins (provided by the Babel preset) and more.

They will resolve your modules recursively and bundle them in one file or more if you do some code-splitting. #JavaScript External assets By default, all bundlers include all external dependencies in the final bundle, this works fine for applications, but if you wish to build a multi-tenant application or a library, you don\u2019t wish to include all dependencies, because you\u2019ll end up with the same dependency duplicated. The externals option allows you to define a list of libraries that are provided and should not be embedded in the build, here is an example : module.exports = { ... \/\/ patterns are strings or globs externals: [\"react\", \"react-dom\", \"squp\", \"squp\/**\"], ... js: { app: { \/\/ You can provide more items here, they will be merged with the main list for this bundle externals: [\"my-plugin\", \"my-plugin\/**\"] ... } } ... } In this example react, react-dom and all modules starting with squp\/ will be treated as external You can see that globs were used here, note that they work for Webpack but rollup.js needs complete strings. #With Gulp Gulp will not bundle your files like Webpack and rollup.js do, instead it will generate one output file per input file. This is useful if you are creating a library as it\u2019s the role of the final application to tree-shake what it doesn\u2019t need from your library. Tree-shaking is powerful but is sub-optimal on big files as some code patterns are recognized as side-effects and thus aren\u2019t removed from your bundle even if they aren\u2019t used. #Usage with Jest If you include both crafty-preset-babel and crafty-preset-jest.

ESLint comes with a useful command line flag to fix the errors automatically. We bundled a command line tool that will leverage this and help you fix your JavaScript errors. #Linting in development Linting is important but while writing code, formatting is not the most important thing and failing the build for something as insignificant as a space is more annoying than helpful. That\u2019s why in Crafty, formatting rules are in warning mode during development (with crafty watch) so that you can focus on programming and not on formatting. #Turning off linting for some parts of your code You might find yourself surprised with the number of errors you get when you lint your JavaScript files for the first time. Here I\u2019ll explain how to disable linting on some files or part of files, but remember! The linting is here to help you! You should have good reasons to disable linting. Good reasons include: It\u2019s an external library you downloaded, so it should not follow our conventions you are adding a console.log but wrapped in a if statement to check if \u201cconsole\u201d exists in the global scope. #Disable linting on a line To be surgical you can also disable the linting on a single line with eslint-disable-line An optional feature is to add which rules are disabled. In this example we disable the no-console rule. We recommend to do this whenever you need to disable linting in a file. You can find the rule name at the end of the error message you get when compiling. if (console) { console.log(\"Les carottes sont cuites\"); \/\/eslint-disable-line no-console } #Disable linting on a block of code You should use this possibility if you\u2019re sure of what you do. To disable linting on a block you can add the following comments around your block \/* eslint-disable *\/ \/\/ suppress all warnings between comments alert(\"foo\"); \/* eslint-enable *\/ #Disable linting for one or more files When running, ESLint will look for a .eslintignore file in it\u2019s working directory and apply all the patterns to ignore some files. The patterns in your .eslintignore file must match the .gitignore syntax. For example: vendor\/**.css The .eslintignore file\u2019s location changes wether you want to disable linting from Crafty or the Mercurial hooks. For the hooks, the file must be at the root of your repository (next to your .hgignore\/.gitignore). For Crafty, the file must be in the Gulp working directory (generally src\/main\/frontend). #Customizing the rules ESLint contains a lot of rules.

It adds safe defaults to be able to run your tests with your configuration and provides an extension hook that allows you and other presets to extend its configuration. Jest is a Node-based runner. This means that the tests always run in a Node environment and not in a real browser. This lets us enable fast iteration speed and prevent flakiness. While Jest provides browser global variables such as window thanks to jsdom, they are approximations of the real browser behavior. Jest is intended to be used for unit tests of your logic and your components rather than the DOM quirks. We recommend that you use a separate tool for browser end-to-end tests if you need them. Table of Contents File name Conventions crafty test Writing Tests Focusing and Excluding Tests Coverage Reporting Snapshot Testing Extending the configuration #File name Conventions Jest will look for test files with any of the following popular naming conventions: Files with .js suffix in __tests__ folders. Files with .test.js suffix. Files with .spec.js suffix. The .test.js \/ .spec.js files (or the __tests__ folders) can be located at any depth under the src top level folder. We recommend to put the test files (or __tests__ folders) next to the code they are testing so that relative imports appear shorter. For example, if App.test.js and App.js are in the same folder, the test needs to import App from '.\/App' instead of a long relative path. Using crafty-preset-babel will add jsx as a supported test file extension and crafty-preset-typescript will add the support for ts and tsx To be able to use .ts or .tsx test files, you\u2019ll have to add @types\/jest as a dependency : npm install --save @types\/jest #crafty test Running crafty test will run all test and exit. But you can use any option provided by Jest itself. For example crafty test --watch will run your tests in watch mode. This mode will run all your tests once and once it\u2019s done will wait for code or test changes to re-run the concerned tests. #Writing Tests To create tests, add it() (or test()) blocks with the name of the test and its code. You may optionally wrap them in describe() blocks for logical grouping but this is neither required nor recommended. Jest provides a built-in expect() global function for making assertions. A basic test could look like this: import sum from \".\/sum\"; it(\"sums numbers\", () =&gt; { expect(sum(1, 2)).toEqual(3); expect(sum(2, 2)).toEqual(4); }); All expect() matchers supported by Jest are extensively documented here. You can also use jest.fn() and expect(fn).toBeCalled() to create \u201cspies\u201d or mock functions. #Focusing and Excluding Tests You can replace it() with xit() to temporarily exclude a test from being executed. Similarly, fit() lets you focus on a specific test without running any other tests. #Coverage Reporting Jest has an integrated coverage reporter that works well with EcmaScript 2015+ and requires no configuration. Run crafty test --coverage to include a coverage report like this: Note that tests run much slower with coverage. We recommend to run it separately from your normal workflow. #Snapshot Testing Snapshot testing is a feature of Jest that automatically generates text snapshots of your components and saves them on the disk so if the UI output changes, you get notified without manually writing any assertions on the component output. Read more about snapshot testing. #Extending the configuration Each preset and crafty.config.js can define the jest(crafty, options) function to override Jest\u2019s configuration. const path = require(\"path\"); const MODULES = path.join(__dirname, \"..\", \"node_modules\"); module.exports = { \/** * Represents the extension point for rollup configuration * @param {Crafty} crafty - The instance of Crafty. * @param {Object} options - The Jest configuration object *\/ jest(crafty, options) { \/\/ Adds this directory to resolve modules options.moduleDirectories.push(MODULES); \/\/ Add a transformer for TypeScript options.transform[\"^.+\\\\.tsx?$\"] = require.resolve(\"ts-jest\"); \/\/ Add file extensions to resolve imports options.moduleFileExtensions.push(\"ts\"); options.moduleFileExtensions.push(\"tsx\"); } }; The full list of available configuration option is available on the official website.","tags":"","url":"Packages\/crafty_preset_jest\/index.html"},{"title":"Jest IDE Integration","text":"Table of Contents IDE plugins Jest\u2019s IDE integration relies in general on the jest.config.js files.

Table of Contents Two available presets: Legacy and Recommended Linting in development Turning off linting for some parts of your code Disable linting for a line Disable linting for a section Disable linting for one or more files Customizing the rules #Two available presets: Legacy and Recommended Our linting rules come in two flavors, Legacy and Recommended. Legacy will check the formatting and common practices. Recommended is the full Swissquote CSS Guideline compliance set including the BEM naming conventions. By default, we check in Recommended mode, you can change this parameter with the legacy_css option in your crafty.config.js #Linting in development Linting is important but while writing code, formatting is not the most important thing and failing the build for something as insignificant as a space is more annoying than helpful. That\u2019s why in Crafty, formatting rules are in warning mode during development (with crafty watch) so that you can focus on programming and not on formatting. #Turning off linting for some parts of your code For obvious reasons, you shouldn\u2019t disable linting on your files, but sometimes, it\u2019s necessary. Some browser specific hacks or other tweaks may come as false positives in the linter or you want to ignore a folder containing external libraries. #Disable linting for a line The best is to use this way to silence stylelint, to disable the parts you know to be correct. \/* stylelint-disable-next-line *\/ #id { color: pink !important; \/* stylelint-disable-line declaration-no-important *\/ } As you can see, adding the \/* stylelint-disable-next-line *\/ will ignore all errors on the following line. The next line gives a more interesting example : \/* stylelint-disable-next-line declaration-no-important *\/ we disable the linting for a specific rule. This is the recommended way as you won\u2019t risk silencing errors that would have been useful to you, you can even specify more than one rule, separated by a comma. You can also use the alternative \/* stylelint-disable-line *\/ comment to disable the current line. #Disable linting for a section You can also disable linting for one or more blocks \/* stylelint-disable selector-no-id, declaration-no-important *\/ #id { color: pink !important; } \/* stylelint-enable *\/ #Disable linting for one or more files When running, Stylelint will look for a .stylelintignore file in it\u2019s working directory and apply all the patterns to ignore some files. The patterns in your .stylelintignore file must match the .gitignore syntax. For example: vendor\/**.css The .stylelintignore file\u2019s location changes wether you want to disable linting from Crafty or the Mercurial hooks. For the hooks, the file must be at the root of your repository (next to your .hgignore\/.gitignore). For Crafty, the file must be in the Gulp working directory (generally src\/main\/frontend). #Customizing the rules The library we use for CSS linting (Stylelint) contains a lot of rules. We created a default set of rules following the Swissquote CSS Guideline, but if your project wants stricter rules, you can follow the example here.

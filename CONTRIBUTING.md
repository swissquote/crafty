# Installation

This project is organized with Lerna to manage more than one module in a single project.

```bash
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```

Those two commands install all dependencies in each package.

## Using the experiment project

We provide a small example project within Crafty to experiment with features outside of integration tests.
You can tweak the configuration in any way you like in this project.

```bash
cd experiment
npm install
```

Then you can run one of

- `npm run build` to build the project once
- `npm run test` to execute the tests
- `npm run watch` to run the compilation in watch mode

# Development

## Running tests

```bash
npm run jest
```
Tests are mainly integration tests in the `packages/integration` directory.

Those tests do a run of the configuration with different combinations of configuration and presets and register the results in snapshots.

# Release

## Releasing

Update the version number in `package.json`

```bash
export NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
export YARN_PLUGNPLAY_OVERRIDE=0

# Do a proper install
rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock .pnp .pnp.js packages/*/node_modules

# Will fail on gifsicle, optipng, mozjpeg behind a corporate proxy, you can ignore this
yarn install

# Run tests (Behind a corporate proxy, the image compression test WILL fail and should be ignored)
yarn test

# Release a canary version to test in a project
yarn publish:canary -- --new-version 1.12.0-beta.0

# -> Test inside one or more projects

yarn publish:all
```
